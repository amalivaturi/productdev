Board allows us to take the tickets we've create with Epics and Issues and organize them in our workflow. 


	This is a typical Kanban board; however, rather than organizing the issues, we can just move our epics and filter the issues on the left most column to view the issues in a particular epic. 

	In this example,  My current sprint is based around creating functions out of the built out model. Therefore, all my epics live in the product backlog other than the epics I am currently working on in the current sprint which is in the sprint backlog

## Note on pipelines:
			
1.) Issues
				
				Issues added to an epic will be automatically added here. This pipe can act as a log to view the tasks within your filter. 


2.) Move the necessary epics into the product and sprint backlog
		
			epics that are in the current sprint go to the sprint backlog and other epics to do go into the product backlog.
			
3.) Epics being tackled are in the "In Progress" pipeline

			epics in the "In Progress" pipeline can be managed and detailed through issues as developers collaborate. 
			
4.) Review the epics upon completion and close the item.
		
			confirm the epic is functional and complete then move item from Done to Closed



## Building an Issue
1.)  An Issue builds the framework for an epic which gives a robust set of features to configure to an issue or epic
	
		**pipeline**: Selecting the workflow the issue exists in 
		**Assignees**: Assign those responsible for completing Issue or Epic
		**Labels**: This allows for us to tag topics, issues and types of projects
		**Sprints**: assign an issue or epic to a sprint
		**Releases**: link the workflow to a planned release
		**Linked Pull Request:** allows you to automate a pull request of the a developers local code to the main development base upon the completion of that ticket

	
2.) Add Dependency

	Add dependent epics or issues to solve before you can solve and close this epic or issue.

## Filtering issues 
**1.) By Epic**
In order to view the related issues to an epic filter the board by an epic. 
**2.) By Sprint**
In order to view the related issues assigned to a sprint
**3.) By Assignee**
In order to view the related issues assigned to a person
**4.) By Label**
**5.) By Repository(associated codebase)**






			
As our tickets are built out, and our first sprint to functionalize the models and integrate it into a single class is underway, we need to consider how we can develop this with multiple developers. We can get started with [[About Github]]
