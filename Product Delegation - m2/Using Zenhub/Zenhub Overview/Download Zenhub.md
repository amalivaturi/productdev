## Benefits of the ZenHub extension

-   **Stay inside of GitHub:** With the extension, you can access ZenHub directly within your GitHub repositories. This eliminates the need to context switch between different platforms.
-   **Single source of truth:** We leverage your real-time underlying GitHub data to power your reports and roadmap.
-   **Start immediately:** ZenHub does not require configuration or separate logins. Login directly with GitHub
