Projects,epics and issues are the building blocks of the actionable tasks we look to solve.  This allows to evaluate progress at multiple levels.


1.) [[Projects]]
		
	A project is a grouping of epics. This can be represented as one of our business features from the house of quality. Our Forecast Example: We have entered our business features as our project titles on the left.

2.) [[Epics]]

	An Epic is a system module that helps fulfill a project. Add the system requirement to the relevant business features by adding epics into the project. When assigning issues, you can add more system reqs for a project as you see fit. The HoQ is just a starting point and a live document.

Now that we understad the building blocks, we can start assigning a timeline to our projects and epics in the [[Roadmap]] feature.
