## Overview

ZenHub is not your typical GitHub Issue tracker. For one, every feature is crafted specifically for fast-moving software teams. Rather than forcing teams to leave GitHub and jump into another tool (resulting in double work, informational silos, and missed updates), it transforms GitHub into a fully-featured project management platform.

  

Wasted time spent context switching is eliminated. And because everything is fuelled by your GitHub Issues and Pull Requests, you're always working from the most up-to-date data possible. It's the fullest possible integration where you already work.

  

To use ZenHub, simply download our robust browser extension for Firefox or Chrome. Once you accept the permissions and sign in with GitHub, you'll notice a host of features added right into your GitHub interface.

## How Zenhub helps teams

-   **More accurate metrics:** Third-party tools result in **silos of information**. By creating a single source of truth, your data is **always up to date**. Changes and updates are **powered by the code**, not reliant on manual updates.
-   **Focus on product, not process:** When everything is centralized, project managers spend less time managing people and more time managing the projectâ€”removing roadblocks and ensuring the next release is on track.
-   **Collaboration as a Habit:** GitHub Issues were **built for collaboration**. Collaboration not only helps reduce error and technical debt, it actually keeps teams happier and connected to their work.
