GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.

GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.

GitHub is so user-friendly, though, that some people even use GitHub to manage other types of projects – [like writing books](http://braythwayt.com/2015/01/29/how-i-write-books-with-github-and-leanpub.html).

Additionally, anyone can sign up and host a public code repository for free, which makes GitHub especially popular with open-source projects.

As a company, GitHub makes money by selling hosted private code repositories, as well as other business-focused plans that make it easier for organizations to manage team members and security.

Github also seamlessly inegrates with many powerful applications inlcuding Azure, VS Code and so on. Github provides a platform where Athingz can build their development process on from the ground up.

	The landing page gives a first look into everything we can accomplish on github.
	1.) The Code Page allows you to access the source code or any various branches yet to be merged. This is where the developers will manage the gitflow for progress.
	2.) Issues and pull requests allows developers to document issues and request pieces of code upon completion when collaborating. 
	3.) [[Zenhub]] is where we will organize our work from the [[System of Quality]]. This is project management central for management all the way to the developers. 
	4.) Actions allows us to automate testing or pull requests upon completion as well a multitude of other administrative tasks.
	5.) Wiki is a great tool for documentation - These notes are built on it!
	6.) Security allows you to set up security protocols for the codebase
	7.) Insights allows us to take a look at the repo traffic
	8.) Settings allow us to manage the repo settings and admin priviledges
