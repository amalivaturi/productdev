The House of Quality (HOQ) is defined as a product planning matrix that is built to show how customer requirements relate directly to the ways and methods companies can use to achieve those requirements. House of Quality diagrams use a design that resembles the outline of a house and can be created using [technical and competitive benchmarking](https://asq.org/quality-resources/benchmarking) data. HOQ is considered the primary tool used during [quality function deployment](https://asq.org/quality-resources/qfd-quality-function-deployment) to help facilitate group [decision making](https://asq.org/quality-resources/decision-making-tools).

Benefits of building a House of Quality include:

-   A customer’s needs and requirements are established, then used to build and prioritize service offerings and products.
-   Identifying customer needs and requirements, then ensuring they are achieved, leads to customer satisfaction and loyalty.
-   Improving a company’s understanding of its customers, which leads to better customer utilization, overall sales, and share of wallet.
-   Encouraging communication and collaboration in the product development process.

House of Quality diagrams rely heavily on identifying and maintaining the [[voice of the customer (VOC)]](https://asq.org/quality-resources/voice-of-the-customer). VOC is a way of obtaining and implementing the customer’s stated needs and requirements for their services or products.

## TECHNICAL BENCHMARKING

Technical benchmarking means determining how well both your organization and the competition fulfill customer needs in terms of design requirements.This work is usually performed by design staff to ascertain the capabilities of products or services, especially in comparison to the products or services of leading competitors.

You can plot this evaluation as a score on the vertical axis of a House of Quality, as shown in the figure below. Some people score the design requirements on a scale of one to four, with four being the best. This method results in a plot across the bottom of the House of Quality.

## COMPETITIVE BENCHMARKING (OPTIONAL)

Competitive benchmarking compares one company against a selection of leading competitors. The company is evaluated based on how well or poorly it’s doing by examining and understanding the important aspects associated with its product or services.

Add another "room" on the right side of the House of Quality to reflect how well your organization and the competition satisfy customer requirements (identified on the vertical axis on the left side of the matrix). As in the case of technical benchmarking, plot this evaluation as a graph. You can also add more columns to the right side of the matrix to include other information as needed.

Comparing the results of the technical and competitive benchmarking data should show a consistency. If a product scores high in the competitive comparison, it should also score high on the technical comparison. Treat inconsistencies as flags signaling a potential problem with a design requirement.

This completes the House of Quality. Each of the appropriate organizations and ad hoc teams developing the products and services can put this information to use. The integrated product and process development team then manages the development of the other matrices to ensure the complete and effective design and development of the customer offering.

## IDENTIFYING BENCHMARK FEATURES USING HOUSE OF QUALITY

Establishing business features is needed as it will start the project delegation process. It represents the pillars of each customer requirement. SMEs will be able to create projects for each [[business feature]]



With our understanding of the HoQ, we can follow along with an example: [[House of Quality - An Example]]
