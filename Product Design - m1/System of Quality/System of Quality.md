The System of Quality can be similarily constructed to the house of quality. The correlation of the systems; however, is optional depending the on the complexity of the project. For this documentation, we will assume the correlation effects between systems are negligable



# Filling in the System Requirements

Systems of Quality are built from the [[House of Quality]] business features as the basis. Systems of quality can help establish:
1.) Goal benchmarks
2.) Granular solutions and tasks
3.) supplimentary and complimentary tasks

In the system of quality we look to parse the [[voice of the customer (VOC)]] down to the system requirements to bridge the gap between customers and developers. 


## IDENTIFYING BENCHMARK TARGET VALUES USING SYSTEM OF QUALITY

Establishing target values for each design requirement is necessary. This action establishes concrete goals for the design engineers and further defines customer requirements. These values need to be measurable, and you can develop them from historical records, designed experiments, or analysis of what the competition is doing. Once the team agrees on the target values, enter them on the horizontal axis with the design requirements.
