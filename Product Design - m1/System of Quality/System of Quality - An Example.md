	In this example, we are looking to build a demand forecasting tool and planner
## Overview
	A system of requirement may not be necessary for the breadth of your project. Use if needed.
1.) Gather Business Feature
2.) Research and Plan system modules (requirements)
3.) Build the system of quality matrix
4.) Calculate system requirement importance rating

## Gather [[Business Features]]

![[system-feature.png]]

	This example just ports the business features built in the house of quality.
	
	

## Plan [[System Requirements]]

![[system-reqs.png]]

	These system requirements are more generic; however, as more research is done, relevant KPIs can be associated with the system requirements. 
	
## Build [[System Relationship Matrix]]

![[system_matrix.png]]

	We can define the system relationship matrix with a similar process to the house of quality. 
	
	
## Calculate the system importance matrix
	Use the previously calculated [[Feature Importance]] to fill in the column next to the features.
	
	Using the multiply and sum down column method, calculate a relative importance rating of each system module and their percentage importance.

## The Full [[System of Quality]]
	The system of quality allows you to take robust business features and break them down into engineering projects (or system modules). In the next step, we will be creating our business features and system requirements into the building blocks of our project delegation and planning approach
	
Now that we've investigated the business features and system requirements, we can approach how we plan to tackle fulfilling those requirements in a integrated environment with Zenhub and Github.  Get started with [[Github overview]]
